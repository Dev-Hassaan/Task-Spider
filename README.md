# 🕸️ Task Spider — From To-Do to Total Control

**Task Spider** is a dynamic task management web app that starts as a basic to-do list and grows into an advanced productivity solution. Built with **React** and **Bootstrap** (For now later the CSS Framework will be changed), it’s designed for developers who want to watch a project evolve — feature by feature, step by step.
